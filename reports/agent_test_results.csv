9,Information about the pokemon Aggron,"Where do I get Aggron in Ruby, Sapphire, or Emerald?",yes,pokemon,"To catch an Aggron in Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, or Emerald, you'll need to evolve a Lairon into it. However, Lairon can be found by trading with the player in another game (such as FireRed, LeafGreen, or Diamond/Pearl), but if you're looking for an alternative method.  In those games, there's no wild encounter, so I'm assuming that might have been what you were asking about?"

12,Information about Aerodactyl,How do I obtain Aerodactyl in FireRed/LeafGreen?,no,,"Aerodactyl can be obtained through a glitch in the game. To get it, you'll need to follow these steps:  1. Start by letting your team run away from wild Aerodactyl. 2. When your team flees, go back and face the wild Aerodactyl again. 3. Once the battle starts, let your team's first move (usually the one with the lowest PP) hit the Aerodactyl. 4. Immediately after this, have another member of your team (preferably with a high Attack stat) use an attack on the Aerodactyl that is not super effective or not very effective against it. 5. The key here is to let Aerodactyl's first move (which will likely be a weak one due to its low HP) hit, then immediately have another team member use an attack. 6. This will cause the game to glitch and switch out the opponent with an Aerodactyl from your team.   Note: Keep in mind that this method requires some luck, so it may take multiple attempts to successfully catch the Aerodactyl.  Also note that some people consider this a glitch, but many players use this as a legitimate way of catching the Pokémon."
