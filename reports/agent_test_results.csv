20,Alolan forms evolution info,Is Alolan Raichu an evolution and how?,"Alolan Raichu is indeed an evolution of Raichu, but it's not a traditional one in the sense that you can't evolve Raichu into Alolan Raichu.  Instead, Alolan Raichu is a regional variant of Raichu. It was introduced in Pokémon Sun and Moon as part of the Alola region's unique characteristics.  In other words, if you have Raichu from the Kanto region (which can be obtained through trade or evolution from Pikachu), it will naturally evolve into Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone. However, if you encounter Raichu in the wild in the Alola region or obtain it through other means within the Alola region, it will not have the ""Raichu"" label and is actually referred to as Alolan Raichu.  So, while Alolan Raichu isn't a direct evolution of Raichu in the traditional sense, it's still closely related and shares many characteristics with its Kanto counterpart."

In later games like Gold, Silver, Crystal, Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed, LeafGreen, Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, Black, White, Black 2, and White 2, you can either buy one from Celadon City or find it in the wild on specific routes. For example:  * In Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, you need to show Bill's Grandfather a Growlithe to get it. * In Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, Black, and White, you need to visit Fuego Ironworks or Stark Mountain (with a Dowsing Machine) to find it.

However, here are some ways to get your hands on a Water Stone:  1. **Complete certain quests**: In Pokémon games like HeartGold and SoulSilver, you need to complete the Bug Catching Contest in National Park to obtain a Water Stone. 2. **Trade with other players**: You can trade with other players who have obtained a Water Stone through their own adventures. 3. **Participate in special events**: Some Pokémon games offer special events or challenges that reward Water Stones as prizes. 4. **Purchase from specific NPCs**: In some games, like Pokémon Black and White, you can buy a Water Stone from certain NPCs (non-playable characters) by answering specific questions or completing tasks.
