# AMC Assignment

A local LLM chatbot using Ollama and `noahs_local_ollama_chat_agent` with a consolidated Pokémon knowledge base.

## Prerequisites
- macOS, zsh
- Ollama installed and a model pulled (e.g., `llama3.2:3b`)
- Python 3.11

## Setup
```zsh
# From repo root
./myenv/bin/python3.11 -m pip install -r requirements.txt  # if you use a requirements file
```

## Run
```zsh
# Start Ollama separately
ollama run llama3.2:3b  # or ensure the model is installed

# Chat demo
./myenv/bin/python3.11 test.py
```

## Notes
- Semantic debug is enabled in `test.py` to show which chunks are retrieved.
- `.gitignore` excludes the local venv (`myenv/`) and DB/cache artifacts.
- The consolidated KB is at `data/processed/pokemon_kb.txt` and is regenerated by `preprocessing/build_kb.py`.
